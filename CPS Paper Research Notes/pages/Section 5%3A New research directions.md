- Identifying new research directions based on the analysis (15 points total)
	- Include a good summary of potential future research directions: End by stating the

	  addressed through future research.
	- The new research directions relate to the analysis (5 points)
	- The new research directions answer meaningful research questions (i.e., no “test more
	  models of the devices tested in the papers”) and are feasible (5 points)
	- At least one research direction is identified and described in detail (5 points)
