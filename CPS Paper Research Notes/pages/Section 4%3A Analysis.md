- Extracting meaning from your taxonomy (20 points total)
	- The analysis relates to the categorization of papers and provides meaningful takeaways
	  rather than basic observations about or summaries of information in the set (i.e., the
	  analysis should NOT just be a summary of the papers or a generic observation like “X%
	  of the papers focus on this subtopic”, but it can be, for example, “ X% of papers focus on
	  this subtopic, but they neglect to consider factor Y even though this factor is meaningful
	  for reason Z”) (10 points)
	- The analysis is accurate for the set of reviewed papers and does not rely on heavily
	  cherry-picking the set (e.g., do NOT pick 10 papers on side-channel analysis relating to
	  acoustic and power side channels and make the claim that there is no research on EM
	  side channels). Note that we do not expect you to know the entire body of research on
	  the topic, but there should not be an excessive number of papers that contradict your
	  takeaway claim (10 points)

	- Much of the existing research in regard to Smart Home vulnerability rely more on spoofing attacks
