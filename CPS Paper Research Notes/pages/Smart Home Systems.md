	- 3 attacks listed in paper
		- 1st two infer users' audio/video playback using systematic observation and analysis of the multimedia-visualization functionality of smart light bulbs
		- 3rd attack uses the infrared capabilities of smart light bulbs to create a covert-channel to ex-filtrate user's private data out of secured home or office network.
