- Selecting reasonable papers and categorizing them into a meaningful taxonomy (20 points
  total)
	- Selection of at least 10 papers from reliable sources, reasonably recent (last 5 years),
	  and not SoK or review (survey) papers (5 points)
	- Creates multiple distinct, meaningful categories for these papers with reasonable
	  distributions of papers in each category (i.e., do NOT make one category of papers with
	  9 papers and another with 1, 10 categories based on the author of each paper, “fuzzy”
	  categories with heavy overlap, etc.) (5 points)
	- The papers placed in each category clearly belong in the category based on its criteria (5
	  points)
	- The chosen criteria for category placement reveals some information about the state of
	  research on the topic and ties into the analysis (5 points)
